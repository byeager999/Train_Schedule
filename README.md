# Train Schedule

Train Schedule is a javascript based application that uses the moment.js library to calculate how long and what time a train will be arriving at the station.

Upon entering basic information: train name, destination, time of first train, and train frequency behind the scenes in the train_app.js file the time of arrival of the next train and minutes to arrival are shown with the name and destination of the train.  The user's form data is stored in Google Firebase.  

Train Schedule was built with:
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Custom CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Moment.js
- Google Firebase
